    -Xgcprio:[throughput|pausetime|deterministic]
	      sets priority for the garbage collector (gc)

		  pausetime	optimizes the gc behavior to achieve minimal
                                pause times 
		  deterministic	optimizes the gc behavior to ensure extremely
                                short pause times and limit the total number of
                                those pauses within a prescribed window (this

				of free physical memory in the system 
				up to 64 MB with a minimum of 8 MB (default)
                  client mode:  the default value is 25% of the amount 
				of free physical memory in the system 
				up to 16 MB with a minimum of 8 MB
    -Xmx<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K]

                  server mode:  the default value is the smallest of 75% of
                       		physical memory and 1536 MB (default)
                  client mode: 	the default value is the smallest of 75% of
				physical memory and 64 MB              
    -Xns<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K]
	      sets the initial Java nursery size for generational collectors
                  server mode:  the default value is dynamic (throughput
                                prio and genpar gc) or 10 MB per hardware
                                thread (pausetime prio and gencon gc)
                  client mode:  the default value is 2 MB            
    -Xss<size>[g|G|m|M|k|K]
              set initial stack size
    -Xpausetarget=<optimal_pause_time>[ms|s]
              JRockit will optimize the pause time to the given target,
              uses -Xgcprio:pausetime
                  ms            pause time specified in milliseconds (default)
